# FeyiuRemote

An Android app that controls a **FeiyuTech AK2000 gimbal** and a **Panasonic Lumix GH4/G7** camera, enhanced with **AI-powered subject tracking**.  
The app uses **Bluetooth LE** to communicate with the gimbal, **Wi-Fi** for GH4 remote control, and **on-device machine learning** to keep your subject perfectly framed.
